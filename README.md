# pandas-challenge

I pulled some code from https://github.com/shrawantee/Pandas-PyCitySchools to get me over a few humps.  Relative paths and I do not get along very well even in my WiseScript days.  It seemed to work locally i was able to run thru each cell.
Other than that this one was a bit easier with some code built in and I got my head around the scripting.
